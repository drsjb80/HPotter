# HPotter
A simple to install and run Honey Pot.

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/drsjb80/HPotter.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/drsjb80/HPotter)

## Running and developing

Make sure you're running Docker.

To install the necessary packages, do:

    pip install -r requirements.txt

To run the honeypot itself, do:

    sudo python3 -m src

This should create listeners for HTTP, HTTPS, and telnet. Point your local
broser to http://127.0.0.1 and https://127.0.0.1 For HTTPS, you'll need to
accept the risk (minimal in this case) and find one of the Easter Eggs.

When/if you want to monitor who is probing you from the internet, you'll
need to create port forwarding on your DSL/Cable modem etc. Here's a screen
shot of how the might look for you.
